# Insta-Bot

## MessageBot.py 

This is a program that uses Selenium API to automate a message to a person on Instagram.
Essentially, the program utilizes web scrapping to click on the buttons that lead to the Direct Message page.
The user can enter their username, password, friend's name, and a message. MessageBot.py will then login to the user's instagram account. Next, it will search for the friend of the user and send them the message the user entered.

## MassMessageBot.py

Essentially, this does the exact same thing as MessageBot.py except it can message people on a massive scale. Instead of the user entering one name, the user can enter multiple names, to send them all the same message. MassMessageBoy.py can be used to send fliers, event information, or fun messages to your friends :)
